# Jekyll Google Drive

A website based upon Feeling Responsive and Foundation that dynamically allows the displaying and editing of content stored within a Google Spreadsheet. Only those with write access to the spreadsheet can dynamically edit the website. This is done without the requirement for your own server + hosting costs.

This website was built for my local church, as such it the no hosting costs is helpful. Also there are specific tools embedded within the design with a local church in mind.

The original license of feeling responsive is MIT, the license of the code specific to pulling and editing the Google spreadsheet I am licensing under the AGPLv3+. As such the combined distributed work here is under the AGPLv3+.
